		Actually how does it all work?
	</h1>
	<p>
		We need to declare the HTML tag. There is w3c and WHATWG mainly w3c that controls the HTML5 (the current ver of HTML).<br>
		HTML is also sequential rendering, i.e. it it reads and renders the code from top to bottom sequentially.<br>It is all easy and fine while
		learning form videos, but it is quite difficult to practice yourself. But I love it.

		This is the second day of my practice. Let's see what I can complete today.
