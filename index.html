	<p>
		We need to declare the HTML tag. There is w3c and WHATWG mainly w3c that controls the HTML5 (the current ver of HTML).<br>
		HTML is also sequential rendering, i.e. it it reads and renders the code from top to bottom sequentially.<br>It is all easy and fine while
		learning form videos, but it is quite difficult to practice yourself. But I love it.

		Yesterday I was a bit lazy that is why I practice so little. But today I will finish atleast what is on my notes.<br>
		If a&gt;b; and b&gt;c; then a&gt;c or c&lt;a - That is logic.<br>
		In C programming language the &quot;&amp;&quot; is call the "the address of" operator. It is used to assign memory location to a variable.
